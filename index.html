        <p>Hello! My name is Sam Logo. I currently reside in Washington state. I enjoy playing all kinds of sports, but the majority of my time is spent hanging with family. This July will mark 9 years that I've been married to my beautiful wife. We have 3 young children, ages 6, 4 and 2. Two older girls and one baby boy. They are truly a joy and a blessing to be around. I couldn't imagine a life without them, I love them so much!</p>

      <p>Washington is known as the Evergreen State because of its year-round rainfall. The consistent rain maintains a beautifully green and natural scene state wide. It is also home to the famous Seattle Space Needle, one of the largest and tallest tourist attractions in the U.S. There are many National Parks throughout the State. It sits just below British Columbia, Canada opening easy access to many of treasures in Vancouver, BC.</p>
