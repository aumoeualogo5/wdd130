        <p>Hello! My name is Sam Logo. I currently reside in Washington state. I enjoy playing all kinds of sports, but the majority of my time is spent hanging with family. This July will mark 9 years that I've been married to my beautiful wife. We have 3 young children, ages 6, 4 and 2. Two older girls and one baby boy. They are truly a joy and a blessing to be around. I couldn't imagine a life without them, I love them so much!</p>
